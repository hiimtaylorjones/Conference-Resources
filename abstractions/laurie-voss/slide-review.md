## NPM Past, Present, and Future

* NPM Prevents dependency hell
* NPM Supports Semantic Versioning
  * Major.Minor.Patch

> The best line of code is one you don't have to write.

* A lot of NPM users love to create small modules.
  * This can kind of harken back to the idea of Object Oriented Design
  * Just make all the small things
  * The problem with this is that it creates way bigger trees that actually
    take a really long time to traverse. The problem with this is that it sometimes
    eliminates the benefits of actually making small modules.

* NPM is a single point of failure

> If you don't host it, somebody else does.

> Git is for developing; NPM is for distributing.

* NPM is trying to become the definitive front end package manager, not just
  a really awesome Javascript platform.

* NPM is for discovery.
